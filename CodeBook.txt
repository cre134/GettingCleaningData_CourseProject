The section 'Feature Selection' is taken directly from features_info.txt that was provided in 
'getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip'.  I did not change the measurement names because I 
think the format provided are compact and provide a sufficient description of each measurement.

The section 'Analysis script' descibes the output matrix that provides the measurements for 
which I calculated the average for the final output table.




Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw 
signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were 
captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd 
order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, 
the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain 
Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional 
signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, 
tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Analysis script
---------------

The output from run_analysis.R calculates the average of the following measurements for each subject for each exercise.
There are 79 features in the original feature list that contain a mean (46) or std (33) in the name.  
The following lists the columns of the final output.  Column 1 list the subject/participant number,
column 2 lists the exercise type.  The remaining matrix entries contain the averages of the measurements listed.
