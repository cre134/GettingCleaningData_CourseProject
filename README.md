# GettingCleaningData_CourseProject
This repo contains the necessary files for performing the course project for the Coursera course, 
Getting and Cleaning Data.


Step 1: Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

  I performed Step 1 using shell and python scripts.  To generate the merged data set, the user must run the 
  following command in a bash shell:

  sh run_CleanData.sh
  
  This script creates a tidy .csv file that contains the merged dataset called 'cleandata.csv'.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
run_CleanData.sh does the following:

1) Unzips getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip.

2) Renames the newly created directory to remove the blank spaces.

3) Removes commas, paratheses, and dashes from the feature names.

4) Calls the python script print_table.py which merges all data into txt file.

5) Calls the python script parse_table.py which prints the table in a comma separated format.

6) Finally, tidies up the working directory by removing temporary files and mover the original zip file

Comments are provided within each script describing the individual steps.

Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
